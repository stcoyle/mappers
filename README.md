# mappers

these files will create a semi automated process to create a heat map with your data. 
some of the scripts might need some tweaking to be used with your system

example: directories for opening files , ftp client, or rows in the xlsx files where your data is.


mapper.sh - runs everything in order

deleteXLSX.py - python script to remove old files from directories

multi.py - script to parse info out of xlsx files into one csv file

Waldo.py - script to create heat map with google overlay.
